# .github/workflows/deploy-jekyll.yml
#
# This is a sample workflow to help you get started with building and deploying your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages.
#
# To use this workflow, you must do two things in your repository settings:
#
# 1.  Build and deployment -> Source: Select "GitHub Actions".
# 2.  Under "Code and automation", select "Pages" and ensure that the source is set to "Deploy from a branch".
#
# This workflow is designed to run on pushes to the `main` branch. If your default branch is named differently,
# please update the `on.push.branches` setting below.

name: Build and Deploy Jekyll Site to GitHub Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the `main` branch.

# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.

      # This step uses the ruby/setup-ruby action to set up the correct Ruby version.
      # It also uses 'bundler-cache: true' which is the key. This command will
      # automatically read your Gemfile, install all your dependencies (including the correct Jekyll version),
      # and cache them for faster builds in the future.
